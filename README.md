# thingSpeakMQTT
my hobby project for testing thingSpeak MQTT subscribe feature. 

with help of IFTTT, use google assistant and webhooks to update thingspeak channel feed, 
esp32 subscirbes to channel feed and so whenever feed is updated, esp receives new command, 
there are nine LEDs at the moment, each LED is being controlled from separate thread.
